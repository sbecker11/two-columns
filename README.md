# Summary

## ztrack.html

The ztrack.html approach shows promise in moving 
a single redDiv over its scrollable canvas parent
to any desired location (e.g. mouse click locations).

Its chat history for this work can be found here:

Further work will continue
on this instead of the 
two-column html files.

## two-column.html

The original focus of this project was
to use mousemove events to simulate
motion parallax on a stack of red divs.

Efforts on this approach have been
put on hold. I have not found a way
to move the redDivs to a desired location 
using the default position type "static". 

I have found better results by focusing on
solving the problem for a whole page rather
than two columns.
